# Night Sky Asset

Place the high-resolution night sky panorama provided by the design team at:

```
public/assets/sky/night_sky.jpg
```

The runtime will attempt to load this file first. If it is not present, the bundled fallback texture (embedded as a data URL)
will be used so the scene still renders with a night sky.
